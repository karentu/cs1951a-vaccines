            <br/>
            Modern medicine has effectively eradicated a number of serious illnesses
            through the widespread adoption of vaccines. Recently, however, a number
            of these diseases have made a comeback, perhaps attributable to the
            "anti-vaxxer" movement. Among other pseudoscientific beliefs, members
            of this movement believe that vaccinations cause anything from allergies
            to developmental disorders. As a result, some serious diseases, such
            as measles, mumps, smallpox, and polio have made a comeback. <br/>
            <br/>
            Inspired by the recent measles outbreak in Washington, we’ve decided
             to use data science to explore the relationship between child
             vaccination rate, education level, median salary, and a variety of
             other factors in hopes to determine what leads
             someone to become an "anti-vaxxer." <br/>
            <br/>
            We are currently working on: exploratory data analysis!

          <h1> First Blog Post </h1>
          Our first check-in was last week and went great. We talked about our
          current progress and discussed our next steps. After we selected the
          data we’d be looking at, we created scripts to parse and clean the
          data and put it into our SQL database. Each data set was placed in its
          own table. The different data we looked at included: vaccination
          rates of schools and counties in different years, unemployment rates,
          poverty estimations and education. Issues that we ran into while
          cleaning the data is some of the data sets we were looking at did not
          contain relevant  information after cleaning. Likewise, we ran into
          strange issues where Excel would reformat some of the entry values
          in the csv into dates (e.g. 3-5 to indicated grades 3 to 5 became March 5th).<br/>

          <br/>
          For the vaccination datasets, we obtained csv files from the Data.Gov
          website. More specifically, we used the datasets for the state of
          Washington, from Kindergarten to 12th Grade for the years 2014-2015,
          2015-2016 and 2016-2017. The data from each dataset was inserted
          into the same table with a “Year” field in order to distinguish
          which year’s dataset a particular entry originated from. In
          addition, because many of the schools had entries in one or more
          year’s datasets, a separate table corresponding to each school was
          created with a corresponding ID. These IDs were then used in the
          overall vaccination table as a foreign key field in order to link
          the vaccination table to the school table.<br/>

          <br/>
          For the education, poverty, and unemployment datasets, we obtained csv
          files from USDA.gov. This had data for every county in the entire USA,
          so we wrote a script to read through the CSV line by line and only get
          the data from the state of Washington. Then, we inserted this data
          into our database. <br/>

          <br/>
          <b>Next Steps</b><br/>
          <br/>
          Our next steps are to finish cleaning and collecting some more data on
          political/racial demographics, population changes and food desert areas
          if we can find this data. We also wanted to consolidate and combine all
          the data into fewer tables/CSV files by associating everything with a
          county. This way, we can start to do one visualization for our midterm
          report. One idea for a visualization could be to do a map visualization
          of the vaccination rates. We also wanted to get one ML/stats thing done,
          such as a multiple linear regression of some of the data.<br/>
